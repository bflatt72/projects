1. Created a first webpage using standard HTML document structure. 
2. git init /projects/shayhowe
3. set up github repository for this project.
4. cloned the repository to local. For some reason it did not set up origin so I had to also run git add remote origin "repository name"
5. git add, git commit, git push to remote

                JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web
                development, providing developers with tried and tested tools for
                building scalable, interactive web applications. Many modern companies
                use frameworks as a standard part of their tooling, so many front-end
                development jobs now require framework experience. In this set of
                articles, we are aiming to give you a comfortable starting point to
                help you begin learning frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an aspiring front-end developer, it can be hard to work out where
                to begin when learning frameworks — there are so many frameworks to
                choose from, new ones appear all the time, they mostly work in a
                similar way but do some things differently, and there are some
                specific things to be careful about when using frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are not aiming to exhaustively teach you everything you need to
                know about React/ReactDOM, or Vue, or some other specific framework;
                the framework teams' own docs (and other resources) do that job
                already. Instead, we want to back up and first answer more fundamental
                questions such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Why should I use a framework? What problems do they solve for me?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What questions should I ask when trying to choose a framework? Do I
                    even need to use a framework?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What features do frameworks have? How do they work in general, and
                    how do frameworks' implementations of these features differ?
                </li>
                <li>How do they relate to "vanilla" JavaScript or HTML?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Introduction to client-side frameworks</h2>
            <p>
                When JavaScript debuted in 1996, it added occasional interactivity and
                excitement to a web that was, up until then, composed of static
                documents. The web became not just a place to read things, but to do
                things. JavaScript's popularity steadily increased. Developers who
                worked with JavaScript wrote tools to solve the problems they faced,
                and packaged them into reusable packages called libraries, so they
                could share their solutions with others. This shared ecosystem of
                libraries helped shape the growth of the web, and eventually gave way
                to frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                A framework is a library that offers opinions about how software gets
                built. These opinions allow for predictability and homogeneity in an
                application; predictability allows the software to scale to an
                enormous size and still be maintainable; predictability and
                maintainability are essential for the health and longevity of
                software. The advent of modern JavaScript frameworks has made it much
                easier to build highly dynamic, interactive applications.

            <p>
                Most frameworks allow you to use domain-specific languages (DSLs) in
                order to build your applications. In particular, React has popularized
                the use of JSX for writing its components, while Ember utilizes
                Handlebars. Unlike HTML, these languages know how to read data
                variables, and this data can be used to streamline the process of
                writing your UI.</p>
            <p> Angular apps often make heavy use of TypeScript.
                TypeScript is not concerned with the writing of user interfaces, but
                it is a domain-specific language, and has significant differences to
                vanilla JavaScript.</p>
            <p>
                < DSLs can't be read by the browser directly; they must be transformed into JavaScript or HTML first.
                    Framework tooling generally includes the required tools to handle this step, or can be adjusted to
                    include this step. While it is possible to build framework apps without using these domain-specific
                    languages, embracing them will streamline your development process and make it easier to find help
                    from the communities around those frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Getting started with React</h2>
            <p>As its official tagline states, React is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a framework
                – it's not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments.
                For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications.</p>

            <p>To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM. React and ReactDOM are often
                discussed in the same spaces as — and utilized to solve the same problems as — other true web
                development frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", we're working with that colloquial
                understanding.</p>

            <p>React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. It does this
                through the use of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a portion of the
                user interface. These components can be composed together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away
                much of the rendering work, leaving you to concentrate on the UI design.</p>

            <p>In software development, a user story is an actionable goal from the perspective of the user. Defining
                user stories before we begin our work will help us focus our work. Our app should fulfill the following
                stories:</p>

            <p>As a user, I can</p>
            <ul>
                <li>read a list of tasks.</li>
                <li>add a task using the mouse or keyboard.</li>
                <li>mark any task as completed, using the mouse or keyboard.</li>
                <li>delete any task, using the mouse or keyboard.</li>
                <li>edit any task, using the mouse or keyboard.</li>
                <li>view a specific subset of tasks: All tasks, only the active task, or only the completed tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We'll tackle these stories one-by-one.</p>

        <p class="text">From the moment I heard Frau say I had a clone,
I knew that I'd be safe cuz I'd never be alone,
an evil doctor shouldn't speak a lot about his feelings,
my hurt and my pain don't make me too appealing,
I'd hope Scott would look up to me,
run the business of the family,
head an evil empire just like his dear old dad.</p>
        <p class="text">Give him my love and the things I never had,
Scott would think I was a cool guy,
return the love I have, make me want to cry,
be evil but have my feelings too,
change my life with Oprah and Mya Angelou,
but Scott rejected me, c'est la vie,
life is cruel treat you unfairly,
even so, a god there must be,
Mini-Me you complete me!</p>
